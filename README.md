Breakout Game
====
Name(s): Alexi Kontos
Date Started: 1/14/18
Date Finished: 1/21/18
Number of Hours Worked: 30 Hours
Alexi Kontos: Primary (Sole) Developer
Files used to start the project: Bouncer_example.java (From class)
Outside resources used: JavaFX tutorials on website, stackoverflow (for debugging)
Known Bugs: Third level the ball will randomly not start moving and sometimes will. I had a very hard time figuring out why exactly this is the case so the bug still exists, sometimes the ball will follow the wall all the way out of the top corner and disappear. Sometimes the debug menu also does not appear with the D key
Cheat Keys: L - add a life, N skip to next level, D show debug menu, ESC - quits the game
I felt that the project helped a lot to not only refresh my java knowledge but also to help me get in the mindset of deciding which piece of code should be in different classes and how to implement an entire game from scratch.

First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2017
